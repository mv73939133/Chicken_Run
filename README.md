# Chicken_Run
mini project for intensive programming

This is a small game in Java which allows the player to  move a object [ Chciken ] here to move from one side to other.
This is done by chosing two objects[ obj1 and obj2 ] when object1 collides with object 2 , then we write a loop
for prompting the chicken is lost.
